		<h3>Welcome - Get to know me!</h3>
		<p>My name is Jessica and I am from Pittsburgh, PA but I grew up moving around all over the place. I was an army brat and went to nine different schools before even starting high school. Needless to say, I am familiar with change.</p>
		<p>I earned a Bachelor's in Psychology and a Master's in Social Work from the University of Pittsburgh. I worked as a research associate and clinical interviewer in a cognitive psychology lab before deciding to change careers to software engineering.</p>
